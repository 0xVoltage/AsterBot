# 🚀 How to Use AsterBot (Ultra-Simple)

## ⚠️ PROBLEM SOLVED!

You clicked on `install.py` and it didn't work? **Normal!**

On Windows, clicking on `.py` files only opens the code. That's why we created `.bat` files that work with double click.

## ✅ CORRECT SOLUTION:

### 🔧 1. To Install (First Time)
**Double click on:** `INSTALL.bat`

You will see a black screen that will:
- Check if Python is installed
- Install all dependencies
- Prepare the bot for use

### 🚀 2. To Use the Bot
**Double click on:** `START_ASTERBOT.bat`

This will:
- Open the bot
- Open your browser automatically
- Take you to `http://localhost:5000`

### ⚙️ 3. Configure and Use
On the web page that opens:
1. Enter your Aster Dex keys
2. Configure margin (30% is a good option)
3. Click "Save Configuration"
4. Click "Start Bot"
